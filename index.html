                <h3>Ants v. Some Bees</h3>
                <p>In DATA C88C, I created our own video game called "Ants v. Some Bees." I used object-oriented programming to create
                    ants and bees characters with different abilities and used nodes to create a conceptual game board. This project was coded in Python.

                <h3>Awakening of Azazoth</h3>
                <p>Using Java, I created a version of "hangman," implementing word guessers with various strategies. I also created a chooser class to
                    select the word in question. I completed this project in CS 61B.

            <div class="project-list-item">
                <h3>Deques</h3>
                <p>For this CS 61B project, I created three list data structures, a linked-list deque, an array-based deque, and a max array deque (which 
                    included a feature that returned the maximum element of the conceptual list when a comparator function was passed in). The data structures
                were applied to create guitar string notes using the Karplus-Algorithm. I coded this project in Java.</p>

            <div class="project-list-item">
                <h3>Sonification of U.S. Book Bans</h3>
                <p>For Music & Data, I sonified a subset of books that have been banned across schools in the U.S., assigning a sound to each theme that the book banners
                    deemed "inappropriate." Using Ableton, I aligned those sounds in chronological order of the bans; each book is one beat. The state that banned the
                    book lights up on the map on each beat. Because the ear can pick up multiple pieces of information at a time (in tandem with the visual information), 
                    the hope is that the listener is able to notice connections between the states and themes (thus marginalized groups) that were targeted most. I also
                    hope it allows them to draw conclusions they wouldn't have been able to make through visual representation alone. </p>
